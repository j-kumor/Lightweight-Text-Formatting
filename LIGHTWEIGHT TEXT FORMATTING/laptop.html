<h2 id="definition-of-laptop">Definition of Laptop</h2>
<p>A laptop computer or notebook computer, also known as a laptop or notebook, is a small, portable personal computer (PC). Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower lid.</p>
<p>Most of the computer&#39;s internal hardware is fitted inside the lower lid enclosure under the keyboard, although many modern laptops have a built-in webcam at the top of the screen, and some even feature a touchscreen display. In most cases, unlike tablet computers which run on mobile operating systems, laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems, which were originally developed for desktop computers.

<p><strong>Notebook</strong>. A notebook computer or notebook is, historically, a laptop whose length and width approximate that of letter paper. he term notebook was coined to describe slab-like portable computers that had a letter-paper footprint, such as Epson&#39;s HX-20 and Tandy&#39;s TRS-80 Model 100 of the early 1980s. The popularity of this form factor waned in the middle of the decade, as larger, clamshell-style laptops offered far more capability.</p>
<p><strong>Convertibles</strong> are devices with the ability to conceal a hardware keyboard. Keyboards on such devices can be flipped, rotated, or slid behind the back of the chassis, thus transforming from a laptop into a tablet. Hybrids have a keyboard detachment mechanism, and due to this feature, all critical components are situated in the part with the display. 2-in-1s can have a hybrid or a convertible form, often dubbed 2-in-1 detachable and 2-in-1 convertibles respectively, but are distinguished by the ability to run a desktop OS, such as Windows 10. 2-in-1s are often marketed as laptop replacement tablets.</p>
<p>A <strong>rugged laptop</strong> is designed to reliably operate in harsh usage conditions such as strong vibrations, extreme temperatures, and wet or dusty environments. Rugged laptops are bulkier, heavier, and much more expensive than regular laptops, and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use.</p>
<h2 id="laptop-hardware">Laptop Hardware</h2>
<p>Laptop hardware consists of several key components that work together to enable the functioning of the device. These include the <strong>CPU</strong>, <strong>RAM</strong>, <strong>storage</strong> devices (like SSDs or HDDs), <strong>battery</strong>, and <strong>display</strong>. The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the brain of the laptop, responsible for executing most of the commands. You can read more about it on its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<p>Another crucial component is <strong>RAM</strong> (Random Access Memory), which stores data temporarily to allow quick access by the CPU. Having sufficient RAM is essential for smooth multitasking, as it allows applications to run efficiently. You can find more information about RAM on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
